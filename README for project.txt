Cardiovascular_Disease
We will analyze Cardiovascular Disease dataset to find which variables are related to the disease. Then we will use different machine learning models to predict whether the patient has cardiovascular disease or not. The dataset contains information about patients doing cardiovascular disease examination.

Reasons to have selected the topic
Accordng to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke. Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries. Out of the 17 million premature deaths (under the age of 70) due to noncommunicable diseases in 2019, 38% were caused by CVDs.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol.

It is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin. With the analysis that weÂ´ll be performing, we want to determine which variables are related to the CVD's and usisg different machine learning models predict whether the patient has cardiovascular disease risk.

Description of the communication Protocols
At this stage we are considering presenting the analysis using Tableau,
nesting the Database using SQL and access through Amazon Web Services 
Questions to hope response with the data analysis
Age range to be most vulnerable to have CVD's
Weight range is most probably to have CVD's
What are the probabilities that a person present CVD's according to his physical activities
What are the probabilities that a person present CVD's according to his alcohol intake
What are the probabilities that a person present CVD's according to his smoking habits
What are the probabilities that a person present CVD's according to his cholesterol chart data
